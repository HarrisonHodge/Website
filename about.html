			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>
			I am from Le Claire, Iowa which is a small town on the Mississippi with a fun downtown and many places to go on walks. I love walking my dog and finding new places to go. I love reading, games, and listening to music. During my free time I am always up for trying something new.
			
			I hope to be traveling and finding somewhere I want to live after I graduate. I would love to live somewhere warm and close to the city. In five years, I can see myself working towards being a senior software developer and pursuing my passion.
			</p>
			<h4>About My Family</h4>
			<p>
			I have two siblings, one older sister and one younger brother. I also have a nephew who is so funny and whenever I go to my sister's house to see him it is always a great time. Over the summers I love seeing my Mom and Dad back home and going out to eat at our favorite restaurants.
			
			My grandparents also love visiting me here on campus and whenever they come around we like to shop in downtown Cedar Falls. They love bringing snacks and gifts to surprise me and it is always a warm welcome. Seeing my family always makes me so happy and they are really some of the nicest people in my life.  
			</p>
			<h4>About My School</h4>
			<p>
			I attend the <a href="www.uni.edu">University of Northern Iowa</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>Studies</h3>
			<p>
			I am studying a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science Degree with an Interactive Digital Studies Minor. I am on track for graduating in May of 2023. I hope to land an internship before graduating and am always working to improve my development skills.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Fun</h3>
			<p>
			I like to have fun by going out with my friends and hanging out with the guys in my fraternity. I recently joined Kappa Sigma and have a lot of fun attending the events.
